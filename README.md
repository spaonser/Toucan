## New Features üê£

### 2021

- We officially introduced IMS Toucan in
  [our contribution to the Blizzard Challenge 2021](http://festvox.org/blizzard/bc2021/BC21_IMS.pdf).
- [As shown in this paper](http://festvox.org/blizzard/bc2021/BC21_DelightfulTTS.pdf) vocoders can be used to perform
  super-resolution and spectrogram inversion simultaneously. We added this to our HiFi-GAN vocoder. It now takes 16kHz
  spectrograms as input, but produces 48kHz waveforms.
- We now use articulatory representations of phonemes as the input for all models. This allows us to easily use
  multilingual data to benefit less resource-rich languages.
- We provide a checkpoint trained with a variant of model agnostic meta learning from which you can
  fine-tune a model with very little data in almost any language. The last two contributions are described in
  [our paper that we presented at the ACL 2022](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.472/)!
- We now use a small self-contained Aligner that is trained with CTC and an auxiliary spectrogram reconstruction
  objective, inspired by
  [this implementation](https://github.com/as-ideas/DeepForcedAligner) for a variety of applications.

### 2022

- We reworked our input representation to now include tone, lengthening and primary stress. All phonemes in the IPA
  standard are now supported, so you can train on **any** language, as long as you have a way to convert text to IPA. We
  also include word-boundary pseudo-tokens which are only visible to the text encoder.
- By conditioning the TTS on speaker and language embeddings in a specific way, multi-lingual and multi-speaker models
  are possible. You can use any speaker in any language, regardless of the language that the speakers themselves are
  speaking. We will present [a paper on this at AACL 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12223)!
- Exactly cloning the prosody of a reference utterance is now also possible, and it works in conjunction with
  everything else! So any utterance in any language spoken by any speaker can be replicated and controlled. We will
  present [a paper on this at SLT 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12229). We apply this
  to [literary studies on poetry and presented a paper on this at Interspeech 2022!](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2022/koch22_interspeech.html)
- We added simple and intuitive parameters to scale the variance of pitch and energy in synthesized speech.
- We added a scorer utility to inspect your data and find potentially problematic samples.
- You can now use [weights & biases](https://wandb.ai/site) to keep track of your training runs, if you want.
- We upgraded our vocoder from HiFiGAN to the recently published [Avocodo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13404).
- We now use a self-supervised embedding function based on GST, but with a special training procedure to allow for very
  rich speaker conditioning.
- We trained a GAN to sample from this new embeddingspace. This allows us to speak in voices of speakers that do not
  exist. We also found a way to make the sampling process very controllable using intuitive sliders. Check out our
  newest demo on Huggingface to try it yourself!

### Pretrained models are available!

Pretrained checkpoints for our massively multi-lingual model, the self-contained aligner, the embedding function, the
vocoder and the embedding GAN are available in the
[release section](https://github.com/DigitalPhonetics/IMS-Toucan/releases). Run the ```run_model_downloader.py``` script
to automatically download them from the release page and put them into their appropriate locations with appropriate
names.

## Installation ü¶â

#### Basic Requirements

To install this toolkit, clone it onto the machine you want to use it on
(should have at least one GPU if you intend to train models on that machine. For inference, you can get by without GPU).
Navigate to the directory you have cloned. We recommend creating and activating a
[conda virtual environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
to install the basic requirements into. After creating the environment, the command you need to use to activate the
virtual environment is displayed. The commands below show everything you need to do. If you don't have a GPU, remove the
cuda part from the torch installation line.

```
conda create --prefix ./toucan_conda_venv --no-default-packages python=3.8

pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
```

#### espeak-ng

And finally you need to have espeak-ng installed on your system, because it is used as backend for the phonemizer. If
you replace the phonemizer, you don't need it. On most Linux environments it will be installed already, and if it is
not, and you have the sufficient rights, you can install it by simply running

```
apt-get install espeak-ng
```

For other systems, e.g. Windows, they provide a convenient .msi installer file
[on their GitHub release page](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases). After installation on non-linux
systems, you'll also need to tell the phonemizer library where to find your espeak installation, which is discussed in
[this issue](https://github.com/bootphon/phonemizer/issues/44#issuecomment-1008449718). Since the project is still in
active development, there are frequent updates, which can actually benefit your use significantly.

#### Pretrained Models

You don't need to use pretrained models, but it can speed things up tremendously. Run the ```run_model_downloader.py```
script to automatically download them from the release page and put them into their appropriate locations with
appropriate names.

## Creating a new Pipeline ü¶Ü

To create a new pipeline to train an Avocodo vocoder, you only need a set of audio files. To create a new pipeline for a
FastSpeech 2, you need audio files, corresponding text labels, and an already trained Aligner model to estimate the
duration information that FastSpeech 2 needs as input.

### Build an Avocodo Pipeline

This should not be necessary, because we provide a pretrained model and one of the key benefits of vocoders in general
is how incredibly speaker independent they are. But in case you want to train your own anyway, here are the
instructions: In the directory called
You will need a function to return the list of all the absolute paths to each of the
audio files in your dataset as strings. If you already have a *path_to_transcript_dict* of your data for FastSpeech 2
training, you can simply take the keys of the dict and transform them into a list.

Then go to the directory
*TrainingInterfaces/TrainingPipelines*. In there, make a copy of any existing pipeline that has Avocodo in its name. We
will use this as reference and only make the necessary changes to use the new dataset. Look out for a variable called
*model_save_dir*. This is the default directory that checkpoints will be saved into, unless you specify another one when
calling the training script. Change it to whatever you like. Then pass the list of paths to the instanciation of the
Dataset.

Now you need to add your newly created pipeline to the pipeline dictionary in the file
*run_training_pipeline.py* in the top level of the toolkit. In this file, import the
*run* function from the pipeline you just created and give it a speaking name. Now in the
*pipeline_dict*, add your imported function as value and use as key a shorthand that makes sense. And just like that
you're done.

### Build a FastSpeech 2 Pipeline

In the directory called
*Utility* there is a file called
*path_to_transcript_dicts.py*. In this file you should write a function that returns a dictionary that has all the
absolute paths to each of the audio files in your dataset as strings as the keys and the textual transcriptions of the
corresponding audios as the values.

Then go to the directory
*TrainingInterfaces/TrainingPipelines*. In there, make a copy of any existing pipeline that has FastSpeech 2 in its
name. We will use this copy as reference and only make the necessary changes to use the new dataset. Import the function
you have just written as
*build_path_to_transcript_dict*. Since the data will be processed a considerable amount, a cache will be built and saved
as file for quick and easy restarts. So find the variable
*cache_dir* and adapt it to your needs. The same goes for the variable
*save_dir*, which is where the checkpoints will be saved to. This is a default value, you can overwrite it when calling
the pipeline later using a command line argument, in case you want to fine-tune from a checkpoint and thus save into a
different directory.

In your new pipeline file, look out for the line in which the
*acoustic_model* is loaded. Change the path to the checkpoint of an Aligner model. It can either be the one that is
supplied with the toolkit on the release page, or one that you trained yourself. In the example pipelines, the one that
we provide is finetuned to the dataset it is applied to before it is used to extract durations.

Since we are using text here, we have to make sure that the text processing is adequate for the language. So check in
*Preprocessing/TextFrontend* whether the TextFrontend already has a language ID (e.g. 'en' and 'de') for the language of
your dataset. If not, you'll have to implement handling for that, but it should be pretty simple by just doing it
analogous to what is there already. Now back in the pipeline, change the
*lang* argument in the creation of the dataset and in the call to the train loop function to the language ID that
matches your data.

Now navigate to the implementation of the
*train_loop* that is called in the pipeline. In this file, find the function called
*plot_progress_spec*. This function will produce spectrogram plots during training, which is the most important way to
monitor the progress of the training. In there, you may need to add an example sentence for the language of the data you
are using. It should all be pretty clear from looking at it.

Once this is done, we are almost done, now we just need to make it available to the
*run_training_pipeline.py* file in the top level. In said file, import the
*run* function from the pipeline you just created and give it a speaking name. Now in the
*pipeline_dict*, add your imported function as value and use as key a shorthand that makes sense. And that's it.

## Training a Model ü¶ú

Once you have a pipeline built, training is super easy. Just activate your virtual environment and run the command
below. You might want to use something like nohup to keep it running after you log out from the server (then you should
also add -u as option to python) and add an & to start it in the background. Also, you might want to direct the std:out
and std:err into a specific file using > but all of that is just standard shell use and has nothing to do with the
toolkit.

```
python run_training_pipeline.py <shorthand of the pipeline>
```

You can supply any of the following arguments, but don't have to (although for training you should definitely specify at
least a GPU ID). It is recommended to download the pretrained checkpoint from the releases and use it as basis for
fine-tuning for any new model that you train to significantly reduce training time.

```
--gpu_id <ID of the GPU you wish to use, as displayed with nvidia-smi, default is cpu> 

--resume_checkpoint <path to a checkpoint to load>

--resume (if this is present, the furthest checkpoint available will be loaded automatically)

--finetune (if this is present, the provided checkpoint will be fine-tuned on the data from this pipeline)

--model_save_dir <path to a directory where the checkpoints should be saved>

--wandb (if this is present, the logs will be synchronized to your weights&biases account, if you are logged in on the command line)

--wandb_resume_id <the id of the run you want to resume, if you are using weights&biases (you can find the id in the URL of the run)>
```

After every epoch, some logs will be written to the console. If the loss becomes NaN, you'll need to use a smaller
learning rate or more warmup steps in the arguments of the call to the training_loop in the pipeline you are running.

If you get cuda out of memory errors, you need to decrease the batchsize in the arguments of the call to the
training_loop in the pipeline you are running. Try decreasing the batchsize in small steps until you get no more out of
cuda memory errors. Decreasing the batchsize may also require you to use a smaller learning rate. The use of GroupNorm
should make it so that the training remains mostly stable.

Speaking of plots: in the directory you specified for saving model's checkpoint files and self-explanatory visualization
data will appear. Since the checkpoints are quite big, only the five most recent ones will be kept. The amount of
training steps highly depends on the data you are using, but 1,000,000 is usually pretty good for Avocodo and 200,000 is
pretty good for FastSpeech 2. The fewer data you have, the fewer steps you should take to prevent overfitting issues. If
you want to stop earlier, just kill the process, since everything is daemonic all the child-processes should die with
it. In case there are some ghost-processes left behind, you can use the following command to find them and kill them
manually.

```
fuser -v /dev/nvidia*
```

After training is complete, it is recommended to run
*run_weight_averaging.py*. If you made no changes to the architectures and stuck to the default directory layout, it
will automatically load any models you produced with one pipeline, average their parameters to get a slightly more
robust model and save the result as
*best.pt* in the same directory where all the corresponding checkpoints lie. This also compresses the file size
significantly, so you should do this and then use the
*best.pt* model for inference.

---

## Using a trained Model for Inference ü¶¢

You can load your trained models using an inference interface. Simply instanciate it with the proper directory handle
identifying the model you want to use, the rest should work out in the background. You might want to set a language
embedding or a speaker embedding. The methods for that should be self-explanatory.

An *InferenceInterface* contains two useful methods. They are
*read_to_file* and
*read_aloud*.

- *read_to_file* takes as input a list of strings and a filename. It will synthesize the sentences in the list and
  concatenate them with a short pause inbetween and write them to the filepath you supply as the other argument.

- *read_aloud* takes just a string, which it will then convert to speech and immediately play using the system's
  speakers. If you set the optional argument
  *view* to
  *True* when calling it, it will also show a plot of the phonemes it produced, the spectrogram it came up with, and the
  wave it created from that spectrogram. So all the representations can be seen, text to phoneme, phoneme to spectrogram
  and finally spectrogram to wave.

Their use is demonstrated in
*run_interactive_demo.py* and
*run_text_to_file_reader.py*.

There are simple scaling parameters to control the duration, the variance of the pitch curve and the variance of the
energy curve. You can either change them in the code when using the interactive demo or the reader, or you can simply
pass them to the interface when you use it in your own code.

## FAQ üêì

Here are a few points that were brought up by users:

- My error message shows GPU0, even though I specified a different GPU - The way GPU selection works is that the
  specified GPU is set as the only visible device, in order to avoid backend stuff running accidentally on different
  GPUs. So internally the program will name the device GPU0, because it is the only GPU it can see. It is actually
  running on the GPU you specified.
- read_to_file produces strange outputs - Check if you're passing a list to the method or a string. Since strings can be
  iterated over, it might not throw an error, but a list of strings is expected.
- `UserWarning: Detected call of lr_scheduler.step() before optimizer.step().` - We use a custom scheduler, and torch
  incorrectly thinks that we call the scheduler and the optimizer in the wrong order. Just ignore this warning, it is
  completely meaningless.
- Loss turns to `NaN` - The default learning rates work on clean data. If your data is less clean, try using the scorer
  to find problematic samples, or reduce the learning rate. The most common problem is there being pauses in the speech,
  but nothing that hints at them in the text. That's why ASR corpora, which leave out punctuation, are usually difficult
  to use for TTS.
